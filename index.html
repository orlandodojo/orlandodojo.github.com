		<p>Welcome to the Orlando Dojo <a href="http://www.codingdojo.org">coding dojo</a> group!</p>

		<b>What is the Orlando Dojo?</b>
		<p>We are a group of programmers and technology enthusiasts interested in improving our craft.</p>

		<b>What happens at a meeting?</b>
		<p>
		  <ol>
		  	<li>We pick a programming language.</li>
				<li>We pick an interesting problem to work on.</li>
				<li>We take turns, two people at a time, pair programming on the problem in the language we chose.</li>
				<li>We take a look at what worked well and what could be improved.</li>
		  </ol>
		</p>
		
		<b>How often do you meet?</b>
		<p>We're currently meeting on a biweekly schedule.  Normally dojo's are held on a Saturday, 
		  though if enough interested people want to have a dojo on another day, we can discuss 
			it and possible make it happen.  It's happened before :). </p>

		<b>Do I need to be a programmer to participate?</b>
		<p>No, all that is needed is an interest and willingness to learn.</p>
